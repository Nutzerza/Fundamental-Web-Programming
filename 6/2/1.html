    <h1>Most popular programming languages to learn in 2024</h1>
    <div class="JS left">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>According to a study by Statista, JavaScript is the most popular language to learn. JavaScript (JS) is a
            scripting language used to make websites and mobile applications more interactive. It is also commonly used
            for game development. JavaScript is well-known for its ability to make websites come alive by adding
            elements such as animations, dropdown menus, and color-changing buttons.</p>
        <h3>Should you learn JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>If you need help determining whether JavaScript is right for you, consider the features in the following
            section. Overall, JavaScript is an excellent programming language for front-end developers to learn. W3
            Techs reports that JavaScript is used as a front-end programming language for nearly 98 percent of all
            websites</p>
        <h3>Key features of JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Examples of popular websites and mobile applications developed with JavaScript include Google, Facebook,
            YouTube, and Twitter. Here are a few reasons why you might consider learning this popular programming
            language:
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is fast. It runs immediately within a web browser, reducing load time.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is easy. Not only is JS a relatively easy language for programmers to learn, but its
                popularity also makes it easy to recognize and implement.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is interactive. JS adds noticeable and responsive elements to websites such as zooming
                capabilities and dropdown menus. These elements enhance the user's experience and make JS an in-demand
                addition to website development.</li>
            <li>JavaScript gets along with other programming languages. As a core web language, JS is closely aligned
                with CSS and HTML (other core languages used to build websites). It also has a variety of frameworks and
                libraries that programmers can learn to specialize their skills.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="html/css mid">
        <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
        <p>Fifty-five percent of the software developers who participated in the Statista survey stated that they used
            HTML/CSS. Like JavaScript, HTML and CSS are used for front-end development. HTML stands for Hyper Text
            Markup Language. It is the standard programming language for documents designed for web browser display.
            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a rule-based language. It determines how specific elements should be
            displayed in a document that is written in a markup language (like HTML).</p>
        <h3>Should you learn HTML/CSS?</h3>
        <p>If you need help determining whether JavaScript is right for you, consider the features in the following
            section. Overall, JavaScript is an excellent programming language for front-end developers to learn. W3
            Techs reports that JavaScript is used as a front-end programming language for nearly 98 percent of all
            websites</p>
        <h3>Key features of HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML provides the structure of a page, while CSS dictates the visual layout. Together, they make up the
                foundation of web development.</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS are user-friendly. This accessibility makes them a great option for beginners in software
                development.</li>
            <li>HTML is platform-independent. It runs on a browser, meaning you can use it with nearly any device with a
                simple operating system (OS).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="python right">
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that combines data structures with easy-to-learn
            syntax. Its applications vary from simple functions like powering a moderator bot on Reddit to complex
            functions such as financial data analysis and machine learning. </p>
        <h3>Should you learn Python?</h3>
        <p>With Python, you can do anything from game development to statistical analyses. If you want to get into
            software or application development but are still deciding which specialization you'd like to pursue,
            consider learning Python. You can use the following section to guide your decision.</p>
        <h3>Key features of Python</h3>
        <p>
            Python has been around since 1991, giving it time to grow and gain popularity [4]. While there are a lot of
            advantages for developers to learn Python for web development and software applications, there are two
            primary reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>Python is versatile. Python is a very versatile and highly-utilized language. Python's versatility has
                led it to be used for everything from basic web development to complex AI systems and embedded projects.
                Furthermore, Python has the ability to act as a "glue" code that connects different programming
                components together to interact and run on every operating system. </li>
            <li>Python is simple. Python's language structure is based in English syntax, making it easier for
                English-speaking programmers to read and comprehend compared to more numerical-based languages. Python
                is also an open-source programming language, which means anyone can download and use the source code for
                free.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
